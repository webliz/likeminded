# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all needed dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `Code quality tools`

## ESLint 
ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. 
ESLint is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of continuous integration pipeline.

`ESLint` is installed and configured in `create-react-app`. It is already enabled.

Hint: Microsoft ESLint could be additionnally installed in an IDE.

## React Developer Tools

React developer tool or React dev tool gives us easy access to the root components rendered on a page via the components tab. 
So we can inspect and debug these components easily.
React Developer tool is available as an extension for Chome and Firefox.

## Storybook

I used to use Storybook in my Production projects. 
Storybook is an open-source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.
I didn't integrate it into this project. It is just an introduction.
